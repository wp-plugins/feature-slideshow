Retrives posts / pages and creates a jQuery driven slideshow, with a vertical list of post titles and a short excerpt.

== Description ==

Feature Slideshow retrives posts / pages based on user settings. It creates a list 
of the posts with a title and a short excerpt. Beside the list it creates a slideshow, pulling out the post 
feature image and placing the excerpt over it.

You can place the slideshow in any post / page by entering the shortcode "[feature-slideshow]", or in the 
code by entering "feature_slideshow_init()" (without the double quotes offcourse).

When installing the slideshow, or making changes to the width or number of posts to show, make sure you update 
your feature image for the affected posts.

This Slideshow is based on the Feature List by jQueryGlobe ( http://jqueryglobe.com/ ).
