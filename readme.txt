== Frequently Asked Questions ==

If you can't find your answer here, please post your question in the forum (my website is currently not working).
 
= The slideshow is going super fast after update =

At update to 1.0.7-beta I changed the intervals from seconds to milliseconds, for better control. Just change your interval time to milliseconds.

= The slideshow stops at the second slide =

This is a jQuery crash that usually occur due to the current theme (or some other plugin) that includes an old version of jQuery. In the popular theme <em>Mystique</em> you can simply go into the file <code>lib/settings.php</code> and remove line 189: <code>  wp_enqueue_script('mystique', THEME_URL.'/js/jquery.mystique.js', array('jquery'), $ver=THEME_VERSION, $in_footer=true);</code>
